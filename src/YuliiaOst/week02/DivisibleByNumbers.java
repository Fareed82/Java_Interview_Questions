/*
Write a program that can print numbers between 1 ~ 100 that can be divisible by 3, 5 and 15.
- if the number can be divisible by 3, 5, 15 - then it should only be displayed in "Divisible By 15" section
- if the number can be divisible by 5, but cannot be divisible by 15 - then it should only be displayed in "Divisible By 5" section
- if the number can be divisible by 3, but cannot be divisible by 15 - then it should only be displayed in "Divisible By 3" section

OutPut:
 Divisible By 15: 15 30 45 60 75 90
 Divisible By 5: 5 10 20 25 35 40 50 55 65 70 80 85 95
 Divisible By 3: 3 6 9 12 18 21 24 27 33 36 39 42 48 51 54 57 63 66 69 72 78 81 84 87 93 96 99
